# BitBucketDumper
It is a command-line tool designed to simplify the process of retrieving and cloning Git repositories from Bitbucket. This script allows users to input their Bitbucket credentials, workspace name, and the desired number of pages to check. The tool then accesses the Bitbucket API, fetches repository URLs from the specified pages, and provides the option to clone the repositories locally. This tool streamlines the task of managing multiple repositories, enhancing efficiency and convenience in retrieving and working with Git projects hosted on Bitbucket.
